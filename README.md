## Development

To develop and test components locally, clone the repository and install
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cbalasa/yori-ui-library.git
cd yori-ui-library
npm install
```

To start Storybook and view the components:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Storybook will launch a local development server with an interactive UI for
browsing, testing, and editing components.

```bash
This keeps the formatting clear and readable within Markdown. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
```
